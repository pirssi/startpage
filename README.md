# minimalist start page

A personal link page with a clock and a background image based on system/browser color scheme.

Edit based on https://startpages.github.io/startpages/Startpage_kopri-nb/

This is a standalone repository for the start page, which is also used on my site [https://pirss.in/start](https://pirss.in/start/) hosted on GitHub Pages, the repo of which can be found [here](https://github.com/pirssi/pirssi.github.io/) ([direct link to `/start`](https://github.com/pirssi/pirssi.github.io/tree/master/start))

For Firefox, files required to enable custom URL for new tab page (both http(s):// and file:/// ) are included in `/firefox-config`, simply replace the URL in `autoconfig.cfg` and drag and drop the files to Firefox installation root folder.
